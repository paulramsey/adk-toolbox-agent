    "# Build an Interactice Finance Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "> IMPORTANT: This is the fifth and final notebook in the lab. The notebooks build on top of each other, so be sure to run the preceding notebooks, in order, before running this one. Start your journey building ADK Agents with MCP Toolbox [here](./1_setup_and_explore_databases.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final notebook of the lab! This is where you will bring everything you've built together to create a fully interactive, enterprise-ready Fraud Analyst Agent. This notebook guides you through deploying advanced MCP Toolbox tools, backed by Spanner Graph and AlloyDB Natural Language, and a user-friendly web interface that allows a fraud analyst to interact with the powerful AI agent you've developed. The key accomplishments include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Building an Interactive UI: You will use the ADK UI library to create a simple yet powerful web interface for your agent. This UI provides a chat-like experience, making it easy for non-technical users to securely ask complex questions about the financial data in the Spanner Graph and AlloyDB databases.\n",
    "- Deploying a Secure Web Application: You will deploy the interactive UI as a new Cloud Run service. Crucially, this deployment will be secured with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), ensuring that only authorized users, such as verified fraud analysts, can access the application.\n",
    "- Integrating All Components: This final step demonstrates how the ADK Agent, MCP Toolbox, AlloyDB, Spanner, and the new UI all work together in a secure, private network to create a cohesive and powerful solution.\n",
    "- End-to-End Fraud Investigation: You will use the final application to perform a sample fraud investigation, asking the agent a series of questions to identify suspicious activity. This showcases the real-world value of having an AI assistant that can instantly query multiple, complex databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terraform Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Cloud APIs: The necessary APIs for services like Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Spanner, AlloyDB, and Secret Manager were all enabled to allow these services to work together.\n",
    "- VPC Network and Connectivity: A custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) named demo-vpc was created, along with a Cloud Router and Cloud NAT gateway, to provide a secure private network for your resources.\n",
    "- Firewall Rules: Firewall rules, such as allow-iap-internal, were configured to control traffic flow within the VPC, including allowing necessary communication for IAP.\n",
    "- Private IP Allocation: A private IP range was reserved for service networking, enabling services like AlloyDB and Cloud SQL to communicate privately within your VPC.\n",
    "- AlloyDB Cluster and Instance: A high-performance AlloyDB cluster and instance were provisioned to store and manage your financial data.\n",
    "- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Instance: A Cloud SQL instance was created to serve as a persistent session backend for your ADK agent, ensuring that conversation history is maintained.\n",
    "- Spanner Instance and Database: A Spanner instance and database were set up with a predefined schema, including a property graph, to handle complex relational and graph-based queries.\n",
    "- Vertex AI Workbench Instance: The Vertex AI Workbench instance you are currently using was created and configured with the necessary permissions and startup scripts to access the project's resources.\n",
    "- IAM Service Accounts: The toolbox-service-account service account was created with the specific IAM roles required to access databases and secrets securely.\n",
    "- Cloud Storage Bucket: A Cloud Storage bucket was created to store project files, including the data for the Spanner database import.\n",
    "- Private DNS Zone: A private DNS zone was configured to enable PSC (Private Service Connect) for secure communication with the Cloud SQL instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Cloud Services Used\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook utilizes the following Google Cloud services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent Development Kit (ADK): The core framework for building and deploying your interactive financial agent.\n",
    "- MCP Toolbox for Databases: The open-source server that provides the tools for your agent to interact with the databases.\n",
    "- Cloud Run: The serverless platform used to deploy and host both the ADK agent and the MCP Toolbox.\n",
    "- AlloyDB for PostgreSQL: A fully managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database used to store financial transaction data.\n",
    "- Spanner: A globally distributed, strongly consistent database used for both relational and graph-based financial data.\n",
    "- Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP): A service that provides secure, identity-based access to your deployed web applications, including the ADK agent's UI.\n",
    "- Secret Manager: A secure service for storing and managing sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and configuration files.\n",
    "- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL: A managed PostgreSQL database service used for the ADK agent's session management.\n",
    "- IAM (Identity and Access Management): Used to manage permissions for service accounts and users, ensuring a least-privilege security model.\n",
    "- Vertex AI Workbench: The Jupyter notebook-based environment used to develop and execute the code in this lab.\n",
    "- Cloud Storage: Used to store the data files for the initial database setup.\n",
    "- Cloud Logging and Cloud Trace: These services are used for monitoring, debugging, and observing the behavior of your deployed services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Flow of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will guide you through the following logical steps:\n",
    "- Basic Setup: This initial section involves defining the necessary variables for your project, connecting to your Google Cloud environment, and installing the required Python libraries.\n",
    "- Configure a New Toolset: You will create an updated tools.yaml file that defines a more powerful and flexible toolset for your agent. This toolset will include tools for natural language queries, graph queries, account status checks, and more.\n",
    "- Deploy the Interactive Agent: You will deploy the ADK agent to Cloud Run, this time configuring it for public access secured by IAP. This will enable you to interact with the agent through its web UI.\n",
    "- Grant IAP Access: You will grant the necessary IAM permissions to service accounts and your user account to allow access to the IAP-secured web UI.\n",
    "- Test the Agent: Using the ADK's built-in web UI, you will engage in a series of interactive scenarios with your agent, asking it to perform tasks related to fraud investigation and financial analysis."

    "We previously restricted non-private ingress traffic on our ADK Agent hosted on Cloud Run. This is a great security practice for autonomous agents that are triggered by an event and take automated actions on your behalf. For interactive agents, however, it is useful to provide a friendly UI for Agent interactions, and the ADK framework provides a built-in UI specifically for this purpose. To make this UI available without sacrificing our security posture, we will replace IAM authentication with IAP to prevent unauthorized access to the Agent, while allowing authorized individuals to safely connect over public IP. We will also configure IAP on the toolbox service, and we'll use the toolbox-service-account oauth client ID to authenticate calls between the ADK agent and MCP Toolbox.\n",

    "Congratulations, you have successfully completed the course! By completing this course, you have successfully designed, built, and deployed a sophisticated and secure AI agent capable of interacting with sensitive financial data in an enterprise environment. You've gained hands-on experience with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and MCP Toolbox for Databases, learning how to create and customize powerful tools for your agent. More importantly, you've mastered the critical security principles and services necessary for enterprise-grade AI, including the configuration of private networks (VPC, PSC, PSA, GPA) and the implementation of robust access controls with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). You are now equipped with the knowledge to build and deploy your own secure, interactive, and autonomous agents that can safely connect to and reason about sensitive data in a real-world enterprise setting."
