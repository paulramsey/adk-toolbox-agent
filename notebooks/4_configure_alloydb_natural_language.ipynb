    "# Configure AlloyDB AI Natural Language\n",
    "\n",
    "> IMPORTANT: This is the fourth notebook in the lab. The notebooks build on top of each other, so be sure to run the preceding notebooks, in order, before running this one. Start your journey building ADK Agents with MCP Toolbox [here](./1_setup_and_explore_databases.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces you to AlloyDB AI Natural Language, a powerful new way to interact with databases. You will learn how to integrate this feature into your database and leverage it as an MCP Toolbox tool to build a more intuitive and flexible ADK agent. The key milestones you will achieve are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuring AlloyDB AI Natural Language: You will walk through the process of setting up AlloyDB AI's natural language capabilities on your finance database. This includes enabling the necessary extensions, creating a natural language configuration, registering tables, and generating context to help the model understand your schema.\n",
    "- Deploying an Advanced Tool to MCP Toolbox: You will create and deploy an MCP Toolbox tool that allows your agent to translate natural language questions into SQL queries, enabling more dynamic and flexible interactions with the database.\n",
    "- Integrating the Natural Language Tool with the ADK Agent: You will update your deployed ADK agent to use the new natural language tool. This will demonstrate how to build an agent that can understand and respond to a wide range of user queries without needing predefined, specific tools for every possible question.\n",
    "- Testing the Enhanced Agent: You will interact with the updated agent to see the AlloyDB natural language feature in action. This will highlight how the agent can now handle more complex and varied questions about your financial data, showcasing the power of combining ADK, MCP Toolbox, and AlloyDB AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terraform Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The following pre-requisite resources were created for you by Terraform. See the [main.tf](../terraform/main.tf) file for more details on the environment configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AlloyDB: The AlloyDB cluster and instance that you will configure with the natural language feature.\n",
    "- Custom VPC (demo-vpc): The private network that ensures secure communication between the ADK agent, MCP Toolbox, and the AlloyDB instance.\n",
    "- Cloud Run: Hosts the ADK agent and MCP Toolbox as secure, scalable services within a private VPC.\n",
    "- Vertex AI Workbench: The Vertex AI Workbench instance where you are executing this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Cloud Services Used\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook utilizes the following Google Cloud services:\n",
    "- AlloyDB for PostgreSQL: The core database service that you will enhance with the AI natural language feature.\n",
    "- Vertex AI: The platform that provides the underlying AI and machine learning capabilities for the AlloyDB natural language feature.\n",
    "- MCP Toolbox for Databases: The open-source tool server that you will update with the new natural language tool.\n",
    "- Cloud Run: The service that hosts your deployed ADK agent and MCP Toolbox.\n",
    "- Secret Manager: Used to securely manage your tools.yaml configuration and database credentials.\n",
    "- IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manages the necessary permissions for the services and service accounts to interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is structured to guide you step-by-step through the process of enabling and using the AlloyDB natural language feature:\n",
    "- Basic Setup: This section prepares your environment by defining variables, connecting to your Google Cloud project, and installing the required Python libraries.\n",
    "- Integrate AlloyDB with Vertex AI: You will connect to your AlloyDB cluster and grant the necessary permissions for it to integrate with Vertex AI, which is a prerequisite for using the natural language feature.\n",
    "- Natural Language Setup: This is the core of the notebook, where you will:\n",
    "    - Enable the alloydb_ai_nl extension.\n",
    "    - Create a natural language configuration.\n",
    "    - Register the tables from your finance database with the configuration.\n",
    "    - Generate and apply context for your tables and columns, which helps the AI model understand your schema.\n",
    "    - Define query templates to provide the model with examples of valid SQL.\n",
    "- Generate and Execute SQL with AlloyDB Natural Language: You will test the natural language feature directly in the database by providing natural language questions and observing the generated SQL.\n",
    "- Use AlloyDB Natural Language with MCP Toolbox: You will update your `tools.yaml` file to include a new tool of kind alloydb-ai-nl, which will allow your agent to leverage the natural language capabilities you just configured.\n",
    "- Use AlloyDB Natural Language with the ADK Agent: Finally, you will update your deployed ADK agent to use the new tool and interact with it to ask a variety of natural language questions about your financial data."
